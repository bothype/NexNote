A Lightweight & attractive Preloader to make your website even more cool.

# Usage
To add NexLoader to Your Website, all you need to do is to add two scripts to you site.

The first one is the main.js file which will execute the task of showing and hiding the NexLoader & the second one contains the css&html of the NexLoader in one .js file you can choose from one of the pre-mades.

All the images used in NexLoader are neither created by me nor owned by me, they are taken from [Preloaders.net(Icons8)](https://icons8.com/preloaders/).
